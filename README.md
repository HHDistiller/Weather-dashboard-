# Charles' Outdoor Weather Dashboard

This project gives real-time weather-based advice for outdoor decisions—swimming, electronics repair, and wardrobe drama included. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches live data from OpenWeatherMap and translates it into snarky, practical guidance.

- 🏊 Swim Mode — checks heat, wind, and UV levels
- 🛠️ Repair Mode — watches humidity and wind for safe soldering
- 🧥 Dress & Drama — calls out soggy sock and bad hair risk
- 🎙️ NOAA Radio + 🛰️ Live Radar access
